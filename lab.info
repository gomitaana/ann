19. Lab: Implementing  Neural Networks
Goal: understand how to create an ANN and the pros and cons of training it (6 hours)
Lab
Using WEKA load and run ANN (multilayer perceptron) example and analyse the inputs and outputs.
Move around the factors such as learning rate, number of layers and number of nodes. 
Record the behaviour of the network. We are interested in observing if it converges or not, 
how long it takes to learn, and how precise it is. These measurements and comparisons should 
be included in your report.
Find an interesting training set in http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html   and use 
it to create test a network.
Implement a single layer ANN (perceptron) using the language of your choosing and train 
it to recognize something small. The user should be able to query the trained ANN 
(i.e. supply inputs and get an output).

Report
Write a report using the comparisons collected by training the ANN with different 
parameters. Include an image of the network and the parameters used as well as the 
error and time it took to train each network. Write a brief reflection about what you 
think is happening in the different ANNs. Other interesting aspects you could include 
in your reflection are: Explanations as to what are ANNs good for. Where would you use 
them? Are they worth the effort implementing or not? What kinds of problems do they not solve?
