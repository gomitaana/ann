Relevant Information:

   This database encodes the complete set of possible board configurations
   at the end of tic-tac-toe games, where "x" is assumed to have played
   first.  The target concept is "win for x" (i.e., true when "x" has one
   of 8 possible ways to create a "three-in-a-row").  

   Interestingly, this raw database gives a stripped-down decision tree
   algorithm (e.g., ID3) fits.  However, the rule-based CN2 algorithm, the
   simple IB1 instance-based learning algorithm, and the CITRE 
   feature-constructing decision tree algorithm perform well on it.

Attribute Information: (x=player x has taken, o=player o has taken, b=blank)

    1. top-left-square: {x,o,b}
    2. top-middle-square: {x,o,b}
    3. top-right-square: {x,o,b}
    4. middle-left-square: {x,o,b}
    5. middle-middle-square: {x,o,b}
    6. middle-right-square: {x,o,b}
    7. bottom-left-square: {x,o,b}
    8. bottom-middle-square: {x,o,b}

   10. Class: {positive,negative}

Class Distribution: About 65.3% are positive (i.e., wins for "x")
